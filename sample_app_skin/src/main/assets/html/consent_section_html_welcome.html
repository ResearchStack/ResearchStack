        <p> The purpose of this study is to understand whether using an asthma mobile health
            application Version 2.0 (AMHA2.0 or “asthma app”) that you download onto your iPhone
            will help you to monitor your asthma. </p>

        <p>The study is funded by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai with technology
            support from Apple, Sage Bionetworks, and LifeMap Solutions. We expect that hundreds or
            thousands of people may join this study. </p>

        <p>
            People with asthma do best if they actively manage their asthma. This app uses your
            mobile phone to help you do this. If you take daily asthma medicine, the app will help
            you remember to take it on schedule. There are links to learn more about asthma, how to
            use your medicine, what triggers your asthma, and how to recognize when your asthma is
            out of control. The information you put into the app will help you track how well your
            asthma is controlled and how you are doing compared to other app users with asthma.
            Although we will look at the data at different points during the study, we will not be
            looking at your asthma information each day. The app does not replace your usual medical
            care, so if your asthma is getting worse during the study, please reach out to your
            health care team.</p>

        <p>By using this app, you will join a research study, so we will need you to formally give
            your consent. We will now tell you what is involved so you can make an informed choice.
            Take time to read the full written consent at the end of this signup process before
            making your choice. If you have any questions or anything is unclear, stop and email the
            study team at asthmamobilehealth@mssm.edu before you sign the consent. If you contact us
            by email, you can also ask us to call you with more information or answers to your
            questions.</p>
