<p>You should continue your asthma care with your usual doctor if you need help with your asthma
    during the study, after the study and also if you choose not to join the study. If you
    participate in this research study, you should also tell any health care providers who treat you
    that you are in the study.</p>

<p>There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences with any research study.</p>

<p>This study does not provide any compensation, health or medical care to participants. If you are
    injured as a direct result of your participation in this study, the Principal Investigator and
    the research study staff will assist you in obtaining appropriate medical treatment. Email us at
    <a href="mailto:asthmamobilehealth@mssm.edu">asthmamobilehealth@mssm.edu</a> if you feel you
    have been injured as a direct result of your participation in this study. Your medical
    insurance, managed care plan, or other benefits program will be billed for this treatment. You
    will be responsible for any associated co-payment or deductibles as required by your insurance.
</p>

<p>If costs of care related to such an injury are not covered by your medical insurance, managed
    care plan or other benefits program, you may be responsible for these costs. The sponsor will
    not pay charges that your insurance does not cover. No payment is available from the study
    sponsor.</p>

<p>Using the app will take some time. Some questions may make you feel uncomfortable. Other people
    may see the app or your reminders on your phone and realize you are enrolled in this study and
    that you have asthma. This could cause embarrassment or self-consciousness. </p>

<p>Be safe. Do not do study tasks while driving. Wait until you are in a safe place to perform
    tasks.</p>

<p>Data collected in this study will count against your existing mobile data plan, but you can set
    up the “asthma app” to only use Wi-Fi connections to limit impact on your data plan.</p>

<p>Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this time.
