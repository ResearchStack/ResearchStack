<p><strong>WHAT IS A RESEARCH STUDY?</strong></p>

<p>A research study is when scientists try to answer a question about something that we don&rsquo;t
    know enough about.  Participating may not help you or others.  People volunteer to be in a
    research study.  The decision about whether or not to take part is totally up to you. You can
    also agree to take part now and later change your mind. Whatever you decide is okay.  It will
    not affect your ability to get medical care at Mount Sinai.  <br/><br/>
    We have provided the contact information for the study&rsquo;s principal investigator above. If
    you have questions, please ask them. Feel free to ask all the questions you want before you
    decide.  Any new information that develops during this research study that might make you change
    your mind about participating will be given to you promptly.<br/><br/>
    Basic information about this study will appear on the website http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov.&nbsp;
    There are a few reasons for this: &nbsp;the National Institutes of Health (NIH) encourages all
    researchers to post their research; some medical journals only accept articles if the research
    was posted on the website; and, for research studies the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
    calls &quot;applicable clinical trials&rdquo; a description of this clinical trial will be
    available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not
    include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a summary of the
    results. You can search this Web site at any time.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><strong>PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY:</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to understand whether using an asthma mobile health application
    Version 2.0 (AMHA2.0 or &ldquo;asthma app&rdquo;) that you download onto your iPhone will help
    you to monitor your asthma. Although &ldquo;apps&rdquo; have been made to help people monitor
    certain health problems, medical researchers still do not know if they really work well or if
    they really can help improve your health. This research study will be different in that unlike
    typical research studies, your will not need to come to a hospital clinic or a study center.
    Part of this research is to see if we can study the use of the &ldquo;asthma app&rdquo;
    completely by phone without visits to a study center or clinic and to study how well the &ldquo;asthma
    app&rdquo; features work. Since you will be using the app for up to 6 months, we cannot be
    certain that the app will help you with your asthma. We will use information about how you use
    the app to make the app better and see if the &ldquo;asthma app&rdquo; helps you with your
    asthma. If you join this study you will still be able to join future studies if you choose.<br/><br/>
    Funds for conducting this research are provided by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,
    with technology support from Apple, Sage Bionetworks, and LifeMap Solutions.</p>

<br/><br/>

<p><strong>LENGTH OF TIME AND NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE</strong></p>

<p>Your participation in this research study is expected to last for six months.  <br/>
    The number of people expected to take part in this research study is difficult to predict but
    may be hundreds to tens of thousands of people. </p>
<br/><br/>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WHAT’S INVOLVED:</strong></p>

<p>This consent form tells you about the study to help you make your choice on whether or not to
    take part. Please take the time to read this carefully before making your choice. If you have
    any questions or anything is unclear please contact the study team.  If you choose to
    participate in this study you will be asked to give permission by using your phone to sign the
    consent form electronically. You should not give consent or start any part of the study until
    your questions are answered and you are ready and able to begin. If you participate in this
    research study, you should also tell any health care providers who treat you that you are in the
    study. </p>

<p>Asthma is a very common condition, and patients with asthma do best if they monitor or take care
    of their asthma. Some things patients can do to take care of their asthma are to use regular
    medication as prescribed by their doctor, keep track of their own symptoms, and stay away from
    certain situations that may make their asthma symptoms worse (we sometimes call these asthma
    triggers).  The &ldquo;asthma app&rdquo; is designed to help you do all of these things right on
    your mobile phone. The &ldquo;asthma app&rdquo; will help you learn more about your asthma, take
    your asthma medicine as prescribed, and learn what triggers your asthma. The &ldquo;asthma app&rdquo;
    does not replace your usual medical care. Our goal is that you will be able to use the &ldquo;asthma
    app&rdquo; to learn more about asthma. This consent will give you more details below about what
    types of things you will be asked to do in this study. The information about your asthma that
    you give us through this &ldquo;asthma app&rdquo; will be joined together with information from
    other study participants so researchers can learn more about asthma and how an app can help
    monitor asthma. This information will be separated from your name and other ways to identify you
    or know it is you. <br/><br/>
    You may qualify to take part in this research study because you are 18 years of age or older,
    have asthma, own an iPhone, and are not currently pregnant.</p>

<p>If you agree to participate in this research study, this is what you will be asked to do: </p>
<ul style="padding-left:25px;">
    <li>Download a mobile app (free): You need to have the AMHA2.0 app on your iPhone in order to
        participate in this study
    </li>
    <li>View a brief optional video that describes the purpose of the study and introduces the study
        team
    </li>
    <li>Complete a screening questionnaire on the iPhone.</li>
    <li><strong>Register an account:</strong> Once you give your consent, you and everyone else who
        enrolls will complete an electronic registration process through the AMHA2.0 app.
        Registration will include entering your email address and other general information about
        yourself.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Health Surveys:</strong> We will ask you to answer questions about yourself, your
        asthma, what types of things trigger your asthma symptoms (that is, make them worse), what
        asthma medicines you take, other medical problems you may have, and your current health. You
        may choose to leave most questions you do not wish to answer blank. Of course, the more
        information you can give us, the more we may learn about how the app works.  For certain
        features of the app to work, you will need to enter what asthma medicine you are taking so
        that the app can send you reminders about your medicine and keep track of any changes in
        your medicine. Those functions will not work unless you put in that information. When you
        fill out a daily, weekly, or monthly survey, you will have to fill out most of the questions
        in order to complete the survey. Other than that, you may choose to not answer any question
        that makes you uncomfortable.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Things you will be asked to do:</strong> We will ask you to do certain things or
        tasks. Some things you will be asked to do every day (daily), other things every week
        (weekly), every three months, and some just at the beginning and end of the study.<br/>
        You will be asked to perform the following daily tasks using a tab in the app called &ldquo;Activities
        (Task and Surveys)&rdquo;. You can set a time preference in the app when you want to do
        these each day. If you don&rsquo;t complete your task in the time frame you picked, you will
        get an automatic reminder on your iPhone.<br/>


        <ol style="padding-left:30px;" start="1" type="1">
            <li>If you are prescribed daily asthma medicine, you will be asked whether you took it
                in the past 24 hours
            </li>
            <li>Your will be asked about daytime and nighttime asthma symptoms in the last 24
                hours
            </li>
            <li>Your will be asked if you took your quick relief medication or inhaler (such as
                albuterol, Proventil, or Ventolin) in the past 24 hours
            </li>

        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Once each week you will be asked several questions about whether you have had any major things
    happen in terms of your asthma, such as visits to your doctor, the emergency room, the hospital,
    or if you were prescribed any new asthma medication. </p>

<p>At the beginning, 3 months, and end of this study you may be asked to complete certain sets of
    questions about your asthma and overall health that we use in medical research, such as the
    EQ-5D, a survey that assesses how you feel about your overall health. The asthma app will prompt
    you to take these at the correct time. </p>

<p>You will have the choice to use the AMHA2.0 to receive location-specific air quality information
    in your area. If you choose to do so, the AMHA2.0 will use the location of your phone to send
    you information about your general area. If this feature is available at the time of your app
    use, the AMHA 2.0 will record the location of your iPhone (in latitude/longitude coordinate
    form) once per hour when the app is open in order to help identify location-specific triggers,
    such as point sources of industrial pollution that may make your asthma worse. You are free to
    turn off the AMHA2.0's access to your location if this feature is available at the time of your
    app use. If you do this, your location will not be recorded and you will not receive the
    aforementioned location-specific information. </p>

<p>If you use a personal health device with your iPhone (such as Nike Fuel Band, Bluetooth inhalers,
    etc.) and you use iOS8 or later (which includes Apple HealthKit), you can choose to include the
    data from the health device in the study. You will be asked if you would like our AMHA2.0 to get
    all, some, or none of the data. You can also choose not to do this and still participate in the
    study.</p>

<p>The app will track your use of the app and features in the app. This way the study investigators
    can find out more about how many participants drop out of the study, how often the app is
    typically used by participants and which specific features of the app are used, etc. </p>

<p>Giving electronic consent, registering for the study on your mobile phone, and answering the
    first set of questions should take about 10-15 minutes.  The daily tasks and weekly questions
    that we ask you to do should take only a few minutes each time. At the end of the study we will
    ask you to repeat the surveys you did at the start. We think that your participation in this
    study will on average take about 15 minutes each week. Your study participation is expected to
    last six months.</p>

<p>We will send notices on your phone asking you to complete these tasks and surveys. You may choose
    to complete the surveys at your convenience, either then or later. You can use the notification
    settings on the iPhone for the asthma app to control or turn off the notifications if you don&rsquo;t
    want anyone else to become aware you are in the study (by hearing a notification tone, for
    example).</p>

<p><strong>What we will and will not do with your data?</strong><br/></p>
<ul style="padding-left:25px;">
    <li>Coded Data<strong>:</strong> In order to protect your privacy, we will use a random code
        instead of your name on all your study data. This unique code cannot be used to directly
        re-identify you. Any data that identifies you (including name, birthdate, mobile phone
        number, etc.) will be removed before the data is transferred for researchers to study. You
        will be given an option to let researchers contact you for this study or for other research
        studies in the future. You can choose whether or not you will permit them to do so. This
        permission will not be connected to your research data.<br/><br/></li>
    <li><strong>Use in research: </strong>We will combine your study data including survey response
        and tasks measurements with those of other study participants. The combined data will be
        transferred to a computer program where all of the information can be used by researchers
        who have obtained permission to use the AMHA2.0 study data. Your study data may be shared
        with other researchers without information that can be linked to identify you, but we will
        not share your information with any advertisers or other commercial third parties. We will
        NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, phone use habits, text message
        content, personal photos, or websites visited. Data will be stored in a manner that
        maintains strict information technology procedures to safeguard participant information and
        to prevent improper access.
    </li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>

<p><strong>YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES IF YOU TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH:</strong></p>
<ul style="padding-left:25px;">
    <li>If you decide to take part in this research study we ask you to try to complete as many of
        the tasks and surveys as you feel comfortable doing and to try as best as you can to do them
        in the scheduled time period.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>If there is any major change in your asthma, or your asthma medications, please make sure to
        record them when you get your weekly prompt. You may need to have the medicine in front of
        you to do this correctly.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Having good asthma control is very important if you are pregnant or planning to become
        pregnant. However since this is a research study, if you are pregnant or considering
        becoming pregnant during the study period, you should not participate in the
        study.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>You should not participate in any other study while you are enrolled in this one.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<p><strong>COSTS OR PAYMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM PARTICIPATION:</strong></p>

<p>You will not be paid for participating in this research study. Being in this research study will
    not lead to extra costs to you other than usage of your mobile data plan if applicable. Data
    collected in this study will count against your existing mobile data plan, but you can set up
    the &ldquo;asthma app&rdquo; to only use Wi-Fi connections to limit impact on your data
    plan. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>POSSIBLE BENEFITS:</strong></p>

<p>It is important to know that you may not get any benefit from taking part in this research.
    Others may not benefit either. However, possible benefits may be that what we learn from the
    study may help doctors better understand asthma and design better mobile applications. During
    the study you will be able to track what is happening with your asthma and your health overall.
    You may learn more about asthma and monitoring your health that may possibly help you and your
    doctor to keep you healthy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS:</strong></p>

<p>There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study. <br/><br/>
    In this study, we are not changing or recommending any changes in your asthma medicine so we do
    not expect any medical side effects from participating.<br/><br/>
    Inconveniences associated with participation include spending time outlined above in performing
    the surveys and tasks in the &ldquo;asthma app.&rdquo;<br/><br/>
    Some survey questions may make you may feel uncomfortable. Know that the information you provide
    is entirely up to you. We ask that you complete the daily and weekly reminders but otherwise you
    are free to keep other questions blank.<br/><br/>
    Other people may glimpse the study notifications and/or reminders on your phone and realize you
    are enrolled in this study and that you have asthma. This could cause some embarrassment or
    self-consciousness. <br/><br/>
    Be safe. Do not do study tasks while driving. Wait until you are in a safe place to perform
    tasks.<br/><br/>
    You may have concerns about data security, privacy and confidentiality. Your study data,
    including this consent, will be maintained in an encrypted database. Only a limited number of
    investigators will have access to any personally identifying information. Although we will use
    state-of–the art technology to protect your information, there is a slight risk of loss of
    confidentiality. This is a low risk because we separate your personal information (information
    that can directly identify you, such as your name or phone number) from the research data to
    respect your privacy. However, even with removal of this information, it is sometimes possible
    to re-identify an individual. This risk, while very low, should still be considered before
    enrolling.<br/><br/>
    Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this time. </p>
<br/><br/>

<p><strong>OTHER POSSIBLE OPTIONS TO CONSIDER:</strong></p>

<p>You may decide not to take part in this research study without any penalty.  The choice is
    totally up to you. You should continue your asthma care with your usual doctor if you
    participate in the study and if you choose not participate in the study. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>IN CASE OF INJURY DURING THIS RESEARCH STUDY:</strong></p>

<p>This study does not provide any compensation, health or medical care to participants. If you are
    injured as a direct result of your participation in this study, the Principal Investigator and
    the research study staff will assist you in obtaining appropriate medical treatment. Your
    medical insurance, managed care plan, or other benefits program will be billed for this
    treatment. You will be responsible for any associated co-payment or deductibles as required by
    your insurance.<br/><br/>

    If costs of care related to such an injury are not covered by your medical insurance, managed
    care plan or other benefits program, you may be responsible for these costs. The sponsor will
    not pay charges that your insurance does not cover. No payment is available from the study
    sponsor.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>ENDING PARTICIPATION IN THE RESEARCH STUDY:<br/></strong></p>

<p>You may stop taking part in this research study at any time without any penalty. This will not
    affect your ability to receive medical care at Mount Sinai or to receive any benefits to which
    you are otherwise entitled.<br/><br/>
    If you decide to stop being in the research study, delete the &ldquo;asthma app&rdquo; from your
    phone or contact the Principal Investigator or the research staff by email or in
    writing.&nbsp;<br/><br/>
    If you stop being in the research study, already collected information may not be removed from
    the research study database and will continue to be used to complete the research analysis. You
    may be asked whether the investigator can collect information from your routine medical care. If
    you agree, this data will be handled the same as research data.<br/><br/>
    You may also withdraw your permission for the use and disclosure of any of your protected
    information for research, but you must do so in writing to the Principal Investigator at the
    address on the first page. Even if you withdraw your permission, the Principal Investigator for
    the research study may still use the information that was already collected if that information
    is necessary to complete the research study. Your health information may still be used or shared
    after you withdraw your authorization if you should have an adverse event (a bad effect) from
    participating in the research study.<br/><br/>
    Withdrawal without your consent: The study doctor, the sponsor or the institution may stop your
    involvement in this research study at any time without your consent. This may be because the
    research study is being stopped, the instructions of the study team have not been followed, the
    investigator believes it is in your best interest, or for any other reason. If specimens or data
    have been stored as part of the research study, they too can be destroyed without your consent.
    More possible reasons for removal from the study include if the Study Director believes it is in
    your or the study&rsquo;s best interest or if the study is cancelled.<br/><br/>
    You are free to remove the research study app from your mobile phone at any time. If you remove
    the research study app from your mobile phone and do not promptly reinstall it, you will stop
    being in the research study.&nbsp; <br/></p>
<ul style="padding-left:25px;">
    <li>You should not feel obligated to agree to participate.</li>
    <li>Your questions should be answered clearly and to your satisfaction.</li>
    <li>You have a right to view your data through the asthma app.</li>
    <li>By agreeing to participate you do not waive any of your legal rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you withdraw from the study, we will stop collecting new data, but any data already collected
    will remain as part of the study.<br/><br/>
    The Study Director may also withdraw you from the study without your consent at any time for any
    reasons, including if it is in your or the study&rsquo;s best interest or if the study is
    cancelled.</p>

    reportable diseases, this information may be disclosed to appropriate authorities. <br/><br/>
    <u>Who, outside Mount Sinai, might receive your protected health information?</u><br/>
    As part of the study, the Principal Investigator, study team and others in the Mount Sinai
    workforce may disclose your protected health information, including the results of the research
    study tests and procedures, to the following people or organizations: (It is possible that there
    may be changes to the list during this research study; you may request an up-to-date list at any
    time by contacting the Principal Investigator.)</p>
<ul style="padding-left:25px;">
    <li>The United States Food and Drug Administration</li>
    <li>The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Human Research
        Protection
    </li>
</ul>
<p>In all disclosures outside of Mount Sinai, you will not be identified by any direct personal
    identifier unless disclosure of the direct identifier is required by law. Some records and
    information disclosed may be identified with a unique code number. The Principal Investigator
    will ensure that the key to the code will be kept in a locked file, or will be securely stored
    electronically. The code will not be used to link the information back to you without your
    permission, unless the law requires it, or rarely if the Institutional Review Board allows it
    after determining that there would be minimal risk to your privacy. It is possible that a
    sponsor or their representatives, a data coordinating office, a contract research organization,
    will come to inspect your records. Even if those records are identifiable when inspected, the
    information leaving the institution will be stripped of direct identifiers.  Additionally, the
    monitors, auditors, the IRB, the Food and Drug Administration will be granted direct access to
    your medical records for verification of the research procedures and data. By signing this
    document you are authorizing this access. We may publish the results of this research. However,
    we will keep your name and other identifying information confidential. <br/><br/>
    <u>For how long will Mount Sinai be able to use or disclose your protected health
        information?</u> Your authorization for use of your protected health information for this
    specific study does not expire.<br/><br/>
    <u>Will you be able to access your records?</u><br/>
    While you are participating in the study, you will be able to view the answers you have given
    through the &ldquo;asthma app.&rdquo; At the end of the study, you will have an opportunity to
    download your study data. Once you have finished participating in the study, you will no longer
    be able to view your study data.<br/><br/>
    This will be done to prevent the knowledge of study results from affecting the reliability of
    the study. Your information will be available should an emergency arise that would require your
    treating physician to know this information to best treat you. You will have access to your own
    medical record and any study information that is part of that record when the study is over or
    earlier, if possible. The investigator is not required to release to you research information
    that is not part of your medical record.<br/><br/>
    <u>Do you need to give us permission to obtain, use or share your health information?</u><br/>
    NO! If you decide not to let us obtain, use or share your health information you should not sign
    this form, and you will not be allowed to volunteer in the research study. <u>If you do not
        sign, it will not affect your treatment, payment or enrollment in any health plans or affect
        your eligibility for benefits.</u><br/><br/>
    <u>Can you change your mind?</u><br/>
    You may withdraw your permission for the use and disclosure of any of your protected information
    for research, but you must do so in writing to the Principal Investigator at the address on the
    first page. Even if you withdraw your permission, the Principal Investigator for the research
    study may still use your protected information that was already collected if that information is
    necessary to complete the study. Your health information may still be used or shared after you
    withdraw your authorization if you should have an adverse event (a bad effect) from being in the
    study. If you withdraw your permission to use your protected health information for research
    that means you will also be withdrawn from the research study, but standard medical care and any
    other benefits to which you are entitled will not be affected. You can also tell us you want to
    withdraw from the research study at any time without canceling the Authorization to use your
    data.<br/><br/>
    It is important for you to understand that once information is disclosed to others outside Mount
    Sinai, the information may be re-disclosed and will no longer be covered by the federal privacy
    protection regulations. However, even if your information will no longer be protected by federal
    regulations, where possible, Mount Sinai has entered into agreements with those who will receive
    your information to continue to protect your confidentiality.</p>
If as part of this research project your medical records are being reviewed, or a medical history is
being taken, it is possible that HIV-related information may be revealed to the researchers.  If
that is the case, the following information concerns you.  If this research does not involve any
review of medical records or questions about your medical history or conditions, then the following
section may be ignored.

    <u>Permission for study team to contact you</u><br/>
    By participating in this study, you agree that the study team may contact you if needed to get
    feedback about the asthma app or to further develop mobile health apps. If you do not want the
    study team to contact you, use the &ldquo;asthma app&rdquo; to opt out of giving permission to
    be contacted.</p>
