 * For example, you might use the image choice answer format to represent a range of moods that range
 * from very sad to very happy.

 * The image choice answer format produces an `ChoiceQuestionResult` object.

     * currently selected image choice is displayed, so text that wraps to more than one line
     * is supported.
