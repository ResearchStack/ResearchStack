/**
 * The {@link QuestionStep} class is a concrete subclass of {@link Step} that represents a step in
 * which a single question is presented to the user.
 * <p>
 * To use a question step, instantiate an QuestionStep object, fill in its properties, and include
 * it in a task. When the task completes, the user's answer is encoded in the result hierarchy
 * returned from the {@link org.sagebionetworks.researchstack.backbone.ui.ViewTaskActivity}.
 * <p>
 * When the ViewTaskActivity presents a QuestionStep object, it instantiates a {@link
 * SurveyStepLayout} object to present the step. The actual visual presentation depends on the
 * answer format and its {@link org.sagebionetworks.researchstack.backbone.ui.step.body.StepBody}.
 * <p>
 * When you need to present more than one question at the same time, it can be appropriate to use
 * {@link FormStep} instead of QuestionStep.
 * <p>
 * The result of a question step is an {@link org.sagebionetworks.researchstack.backbone.result.StepResult} object.
