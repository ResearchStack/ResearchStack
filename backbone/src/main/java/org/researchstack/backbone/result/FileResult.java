/**
 * Created by TheMDP on 2/6/17.
 *
 * The `FileResult` class is a result that references the location of a file produced
 * during a task.
 *
 * A file result is typically generated by the library as the task proceeds. When the task
 * completes, it may be appropriate to serialize the linked file for transmission
 * to the server.
 *
 * Active steps typically produce file results when Accelerometer or Gyroscope sensor data is
 * serialized to disk using a data logger (`DataLogger`). Audio recording also produces a file
 * result.
 *
 * When you write a custom step, use files to report results only when the data
 * is likely to be too big to hold in memory for the duration of the task. For
 * example, fitness tasks that use sensors can be quite long and can generate
 * a large number of samples. To compensate for the length of the task, you can stream the samples to disk during
 * the task, and return a `FileResult` object in the result hierarchy, usually as a
 * child of an `StepResult` object.

     * The file is typically written to the output directory of the
     * ViewTaskActivity, so it is common to manage the archiving or cleanup
     * of these files by archiving or deleting the entire output directory.
