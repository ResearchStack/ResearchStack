/**
 * Generic file access contract for the app.  Depending on the type, there may need to be auth
 * input screens shown to the user.  Also, its possible to implement completely cloud based
 * storage, so the developer will need to be aware of the detail implementations to some degree.
 * <p>
 * Because some storage will need to show auth info to the user before interaction can start,
 * the normal Android lifecycle of Fractivities will need to be modified a bit.  In general, code
 * will hit 'onCreate', which will check for live file access, and if there's an issue, show
 * a different UI to the user to resolve.  A new part of the lifecycle, onDataReady (or similar)
 * will need to be added.  This intended to be run whenever auth is complete, but may happen outside
 * of the standard onCreate/onResume callbacks.
 * <p>
 * Its assumed that in most cases, once the app has authed, file access should be readily available.
 * If that is NOT the case, for example if a google auth expires, the developer will have to implement
 * an exception case flow.  If rare, simply letting the app crash and auth on a restart
 * might be sufficient, but planning for crashes isn't the most elegant of solutions ;)
 * <p>
 * This is highly volatile at the moment.  The interface may change dramatically.
