/**
 * Created by TheMDP on 2/5/17.
 *
 * A recorder is the runtime companion to an `RecorderConfiguration` object, and is
 * usually generated by one.
 *
 * During active tasks, it is often useful to collect one or more pieces of data
 * from sensors on the device. In research tasks, it's not always
 * necessary to display that data, but it's important to record it in a controlled manner.
 *
 * An active step (`ActiveStep`) has an array of recorder configurations
 * (`RecorderConfiguration`) that identify the types of data it needs to record
 * for the duration of the step. When a step starts, the active step layout
 * instantiates a recorder for each of the step's recorder configurations.
 * The step layout starts the recorder when the active step is started, and stops the
 * recorder when the active step is finished.
 *
 * The results of recording are typically written to a file specified by the value of the `outputDirectory` property.
 *
 * Usually, the `ActiveStepLayout` object is the recorder's delegate, and it
 * receives callbacks when errors occur or when recording is complete.

     * The identifier is reproduced in the results of a recorder created from this configuration.
     * In fact, the only way to link a result
     * (an `FileResult` object) to the recorder that generated it is to look at the value of
     * `identifier`. To accurately identify recorder results, you need to ensure that recorder identifiers
     * are unique within each step.
     *
     * In some cases, it can be useful to link the recorder identifier to a unique identifier in a
     * database; in other cases, it can make sense to make the identifier human
     * readable.
