<p>If you use a personal health device with your iPhone (such as a Apple Watch) and use iOS8 or
    later (which includes Apple HealthKit), you can choose to include the data from the device in
    the study. You can set our app to get all, some, or none of the data. You can choose not to do
    this and still participate in the study.</p>

<p>
    You will have the choice to use the asthma app to receive location-specific information such as
    weather and air quality in your area. If you choose to do so, the asthma app will use the
    location of your phone to send you information about your general area. The asthma app will
    record the location of your iPhone (in latitude/longitude coordinate form) as often as once per
    hour when the app is open in order to help identify location-specific triggers, such as point
    sources of industrial pollution that may make your asthma worse. You are free to turn off the
    asthma app's access to your location. If you do this, your location will not be recorded and you
    will not receive location-specific information about air quality.</p>

<p>We will NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, phone use habits, text messages,
    personal photos, or websites visited.</p>
