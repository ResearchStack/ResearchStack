<p>The study will take place completely by using this app. While you use the app to monitor your
    asthma, we will study how well the app works and use the information to make the app better.</p>

<p>The app will ask you questions about your background, your asthma, the asthma medicines you take,
    and other questions about your health. Certain questions have to be completed for the app to
    work as designed, such as entering your asthma medicines so the app can give you reminders. </p>

<p>You will be asked daily questions about your asthma symptoms and use of quick relief medicine.
    You can choose the time each day to get your reminder and do your questions. Be mindful of the
    alert sound for your notifications if you donâ€™t want anyone to know you are in the study. You
    can turn off the sound if you want. Once each week you will be asked about any major things that
    happened such as visits to your doctor, the emergency department, the hospital, or changes in
    asthma medication.

<p>We will not collect information from your medical records. By answering these questions, the app
    will keep track of how well your asthma is controlled and you can compare how you are doing to
    other app users. There will be questions and surveys at the beginning and end of the study.
    Apart from the daily and weekly questions and your medicines, you are free to skip anything that
    makes you uncomfortable.</p>
