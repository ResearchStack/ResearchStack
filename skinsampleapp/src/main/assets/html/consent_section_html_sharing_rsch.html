<p>This study gives you the option to share your data in 2 ways:</p>

<p>1- Share with the world: You can choose to share your coded study data with qualified researchers
    worldwide for use in this research and beyond. Coded study data is data that does not include
    personal information such as your name or email. Qualified researchers are registered users of
    Synapse who have agreed to use the data in an ethical manner for research purposes, and have
    agreed to not attempt to re-identify you. If you choose to share your coded study data, the
    coded data will be added to a shared dataset available to qualified researchers on the Sage
    Bionetworks Synapse servers. (<u><a href="http://www.synapse.org/">www.synapse.org</a></u>).
    Sage Bionetworks will have no oversight on the future research that qualified researchers may
    conduct with the coded study data.</p>

<p> 2- Share with the Institution and its partners only: You can choose to share your study data <u>only</u>
    with the study team and its partners. The study team includes the sponsor of the research and
    any other researchers or partners named in the consent document. Sharing your data only with the
    (Institution) means that your data will not be made available to anyone other than those listed
    in the consent document and for the purposes of this study only.</p>

    may be disclosed to:</p>

<p>The results of this research study may be presented at meetings or in publications. If the
